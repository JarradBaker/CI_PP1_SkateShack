        <h2>Olly</h2>
        <p>
            The olly is the most important trick in a skaters arsenal. This trick is the basis for almost every other one, which makes learning this trick first the most curcial. The main technique behind this is popping your board on the tail end, and sliding your front foot up the board, to allow you to rise in the air.

        <h2>Shove-It And Pop Shove-It</h2>
        <p>
            The "Shove-It" and the "Pop Shove-It" are also incredibly important to learn for any beginner. The technique of these tricks involves using your front foot on the deck to make the skateboard rotate by 180, or 360 degrees. The difference between these two tricks is that the standard "Shove-It" is done without fully popping the back end of the deck, like you would with an olly, whereas the "Pop Shove-It" is done by doing an olly, and then rotating the board.

        <h2>180 Olly</h2>
        <p>
            The 180 Olly is done by combining the olly, and turning your body at the same time, making you rotate 180 degrees. By learning this trick, you can then begin to try learning a plethora of other tricks, including the 360 olly, the backside 180 olly, the backside 360 olly and many more. This trick is crucial for skating vert, so if you want to skate like Tony Hawk, make sure you perfect this trick!

        <h2>Kickflip</h2>
        <p>
            The kickflip is the classic trick that looks, and feels awesome regardless of how experienced you are with skating. The main technique for this trick, is to pop the tail end of the board, as you would with an olly, and push your front foot down on the bottom side of the board, to make it do a 360 spin. Even though it is a hard trick to master, it is one of the most fulfilling tricks to land, especially when landing it for the first time.
