        <h1>Learn Some Tricks!</h1>
        <p>
            This page teaches you how to perform different tricks. These tricks are seen as the stepping stones for all other street skating tricks, as the techniques learned from mastering these moves are used in every other trick. We'll start with the most important, and build on from there. Each trick will have a video, allowing you to not only read our instructions, but visualize the technique mentioned in real time.

        <h2>Olly</h2>
        <p>
            The olly is the most important trick in a skaters arsenal. This trick is the basis for almost every other one, which makes learning this trick first the most curcial. The main technique behind this is popping your board on the tail end, and sliding your front foot up the board, to allow you to rise in the air.

        <h2>Shove-It And Pop Shove-It</h2>
        <p>
            The "Shove-It" and the "Pop Shove-It" are also incredibly important to learn for any beginner. The technique of these tricks involves using your front foot on the deck to make the skateboard rotate by 180, or 360 degrees. The difference between these two tricks is that the standard "Shove-It" is done without fully popping the back end of the deck, like you would with an olly, whereas the "Pop Shove-It" is done by doing an olly, and then rotating the board.
